This is a python module which aims to gather models for Stock forecasting.

The aim is to build a tool that investors can use to filter a large database of stocks into a more manageable list of stocks that qualify for further analysis. There are some free screeners out there, as well as more advanced programs that can be quite costly. Selecting stocks can be a difficult and tedious process, and hence we decided to build such tool. 
However, removing emotion and behavioral biases from the investment decision-making process.

**Install**

We need to install the pandas and vantage package to get stock APIs:

  #To install alpha-vantage
  >pip install alpha_vantage                                     
  
  #To install pandas library
  >pip install pandas
